                  <p class="teaser">
                     Now that many employees have more liberty than ever to decide where they want to work, neighbourhood co-working spots are coming into the spotlight. How has COVID-19 changed the way you view, or use, your home? We could all probably list off a variety of consequences the pandemic has had on our domestic environments. Aptly, many designers have used this time to think of how we might live in the future. Shared spares in specific are clearly up for the most revision: will people truly be able to lean into co-living possibilities as they were beginning to pre-pandemic?
