            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>flwrs</p>
            
            <p>flwrs is more than a botanical and floral arrangements shop, it is a full sensory experience that is meaningful and memorable. Each arrangement is created using seasonal flowers from all over the world, focusing on interaction and connection. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Since flwrs is a more upscale floral shop, the target audience would be people who are looking for a more expensive, special arrangement(s). Also catering to people who want unique arrangements for any event (weddings, parties, or private events). </p>
           
            <p>We aim to create memories and experiences with our arrangements. We want to be the happy medium between a high-class flourist, who does fashion shows and art openings, and a flower shop that you would see in the Upper East Side of New York. Our floralists choose each arrangement based on the meaning of each piece and what it will mean to our customers. </p>
